Hello, my name is Niwton Vladimir Alcántara Alcántara, and today I want to share my story with you—a story of struggle, hope, and love for life. I was always an active person, full of energy and determination. I studied Electromechanical Technology and completed 10 semesters of Engineering at the UASD. I was preparing for a bright future, with a career I loved and a family that filled me with pride.


However, everything changed in May 2013 when I was diagnosed with acute kidney failure. That news completely shook my world. At the time, my greatest hope was that with an extreme diet, I could save my kidneys, but sadly, that hope faded. In December 2017, I entered a new and painful chapter in my life as a dialysis patient, and since then, my struggle has been constant, facing challenges every day that I never imagined.


The greatest motivation in my life is my daughter, who was only two years old when I started dialysis. I remember after my first session, I hugged her and whispered in her ear: “I will never leave you, my love. I will fight until I see you grow.” That promise is what has kept me going because every time I feel my strength fading, I think of her. She is my reason for being, my driving force to keep fighting.


The last nine years have not been easy. I have undergone several surgeries, including two to drain fluid from my lungs. There were moments when I couldn’t breathe, when I thought I wouldn’t survive, but I always found strength in the thought of my daughter and her smile. There were days when my blood pressure dropped so low, down to 90/50, that it seemed like my body was giving up, but my spirit wasn’t. I’ve been on the brink so many times, but here I am, still fighting with everything I have.


One of the most difficult moments was when I had an accident in the hospital while going to a dialysis session. I slipped on the stairs and fell from the second floor, breaking my left hip and right shoulder. Since then, I haven’t been able to walk properly. The doctors told me they couldn’t operate due to the deterioration of my bones caused by dialysis and a related condition with my parathyroid, which makes my bones extremely fragile. This fragility has made even the simplest tasks an enormous challenge.


Throughout these years, I’ve learned to live with pain and physical limitations. Despite everything, I keep fighting. However, the truth is that my financial situation has become unsustainable. I cannot work due to my condition, and the medical expenses are overwhelming. Every week, I have to cover the costs of my dialysis treatment, essential medications, and other vital procedures to stay alive. On top of that, transportation costs are high because I can’t walk well and have to take taxis to my dialysis sessions. This is in addition to the expenses for my daughter and her education, which is a priority for me.


Currently, my medical and living expenses amount to about 130,246.43 DOP (roughly $2,300 USD) per month. Moreover, my only option to improve my quality of life is a kidney transplant, which costs 1,600,000 DOP (approximately $28,500 USD), including the surgery, necessary materials, medications, and tests. It’s a sum that my family and I cannot cover alone, and that’s why I’m here today, asking for your help.


I don’t know how I’ve made it this far, but I know that God has given me the strength to keep going. Today, more than ever, I need your help. This battle is not just mine—it’s my daughter’s battle, my family’s battle, and the battle of all those who believe in the value of life and hope.


Every donation, no matter the size, will allow me to continue fighting, covering my treatments, medications, and the daily expenses I need to survive. With your support, I can keep going, keep fighting to see my daughter grow, and fulfill the promise I made to her that day when it all began.


Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story. Thank you for your solidarity. May God bless you and multiply every act of kindness you show towards my cause.
